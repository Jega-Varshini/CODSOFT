        <p class="intro">
            This task is created as part of my web development internship.
            It is a basic webpage developed using HTML and CSS.
        </p>

        <p class="details">
            Through this task, I practiced creating folders, files,
            writing basic HTML structure, and applying simple CSS styles.
            This helped me understand how a webpage is built from scratch.
